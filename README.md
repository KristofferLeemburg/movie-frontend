A study to make a Netflix Clone build with React and Sass by combining it with a springboot application build by Irene van Dijk. 


The user can navigate with a menu to diffirent pages. Also the company logo is added to the menu.
When the user scrolls down the menu is still visible and transitions from transparant to black.
The links in the menu have a nice hover effect and the menu collapes to a hamburger menu on mobile devices.
There is a searchbox in the navigationbar where you can search for actors.
The searchbox is live updated with each input. 
The search displays a max of 40 different movies in which the actor/actrice participated.
On the Main page there is a movie playing on loop in the background with a matching logo and a customized play button on top.
With the customized play button on the main screen you can make the background movie play fullscreen.
There is next to the play button a more info button with which a fullscreen popup opens that displays a picture of the movie that after a few seconds transforms into a trailer of the movie and a summary and more information.
This will also pauze the background movie from playing which will resume when closing this fullscreen popup.
You can easily close the popup by clicking outside the popup or by using the close button in the top right.
Also there are like and dislike buttons the turn to green or red when pressing on them. This Fullscreen popup always opens 
fullscreen indepenend of where you are in the viewport.
Under the Jumbotron there are 5 movie lanes for different genres that display 40 movies with corresponding movie logo's on top. From 2 different api's.
These movie lanes are horizontible scrollable and have a nice hover effect that turns the individual moviecards a bit brighter and bigger with a mouseover.
When the moviecard is clicked it opens a small popup with a trailer and more information and the option to open it to a fullmovie card that displays even more information about the movie.
In the footer social media icons are added.
