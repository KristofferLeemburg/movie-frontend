With the customized play button on the main screen you can make the background movie play fullscreen.
There is next to the play button a more info button with which a fullscreen popup opens that displays a picture of the movie that after a few seconds transforms into a trailer of the movie and a summary and more information.

You can easily close the popup by clicking outside the popup or by using the close button in the top right.
Also there are like and dislike buttons the turn to green or red when pressing on them. This Fullscreen popup always opens

Under the Jumbotron there are 5 movie lanes for different genres that display 40 movies with corresponding movie logo's on top. From 2 different api's.
These movie lanes are horizontible scrollable and have a nice hover effect that turns the individual moviecards a bit brighter and bigger with a mouseover.
When the moviecard is clicked it opens a small popup with a trailer and more information and the option to open it to a fullmovie card that displays even more information about the movie.
In the footer social media icons are added.
